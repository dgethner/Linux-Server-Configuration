# Linux Server Configuration

Below you will find the method I used to set up an Ubuntu Linux Server on Lightsail.

The server was built to host a Flask application from the Item Catalog project.

##Project Overview
You will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host
your web applications. You will secure your server from a number of
attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your
existing web applications onto it.

##Why this Project?
A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they
are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as
a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, youâ€™ll be responsible for turning a
brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application
host your applications need.

##What will I Learn?
You will learn how to access, secure, and perform the initial configuration of a
bare-bones Linux server. You will then learn how to install and configure a web
and database server and actually host a web application.


##My Server's Details

1. IP Address: 18.218.147.158

2. SSH port: `2200`.

##Configuration steps
### Get started on Lightsail
1. Create or Sign in to [Amazon Lightsail](https://amazonlightsail.com) using an Amazon Web Services account

2. Click on the 'Create instance' link

3. Choose the 'OS Only' and 'Ubuntu 16.04 LTS' options

4. Choose a payment plan (the lowest priced plan is fine)

5. Name your instance and click 'Create'

6. The instance will take a few minutes to start


### Connect to the instance on a local machine

1. Download the instance's private key click on 'Account' in the top bar

2. Click on 'SSH keys' then 'Download'

3. A file will be downloaded named LightsailDefaultPrivateKey.pem or
LightsailDefaultPrivateKey-YOUR-AWS-REGION.pem will be downloaded

4. Open this file in a text editor (I used Atom)

5. Copy the text and put it in a file called lightrail_key.rsa

6. Change the file permissions by running `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/lightrail_key.rsa`

7. Connect with the server by inputting `ssh -i ~/.ssh/lightrail_key.rsa ubuntu@XX.XX.XX.XX`,
where XX.XX.XX.XX needs to be the public IP address of the instance


### Updating Your Server
1. Find package updates by running `sudo apt-get update`

2. Download available package updates by running `sudo apt-get upgrade`


### Configure the firewall

Warning: When changing the SSH port, make sure that the firewall is open for
port 2200 first, so that you don't lock yourself out of the server. When you
change the SSH port, the Lightsail instance will no longer be accessible through
the web app 'Connect using SSH' button. The button assumes the default port is
being used.

1. Change the SSH port from `22` to `2200`
     * Open up the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
		 * Change the port number on line 5 to `2200`
		 * Restart SSH by running `sudo service ssh restart`
		 * Do not miss restarting the SSH service

2. Check the status of ufw (Ubuntu's preinstalled firewall) is active
     * Run `sudo ufw status`

3. Set the ufw firewall to block everything coming in
     * Run `sudo ufw default deny incoming`

4. Set the ufw firewall to allow everything outgoing
     * Run `sudo ufw default allow outgoing`

5. Set the ufw firewall to allow SSH
     * Run `sudo ufw allow ssh`

6. Allow all tcp connections for port `2200` so allow SSH will work
     * Run `sudo ufw allow 2200/tcp`

7. Set the ufw firewall to allow a basic HTTP server
    * Run `sudo ufw allow www`

8. set the ufw firewall to allow NTP
    * Run `sudo ufw allow 123/udp`

9. Deny port `22` (we are denying this port since it is not being used. We have reconfigured the VM to work with port `2200` instead of its default port for SSH)
   * Run `sudo ufw deny 22`

10. Enable the ufw firewall
   * Run `sudo ufw enable`

11. Check which ports are open and if the ufw is active(mine looks like below)
   * Run `sudo ufw status`

	```
	To                         Action      From
	--                         ------      ----
	22                         DENY        Anywhere
	2200/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
	80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
	123/udp                    ALLOW       Anywhere
	22 (v6)                    DENY        Anywhere (v6)
	2200/tcp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
	80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
	123/udp (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
	```

12. Update the firewall in Amazon Lightsail
    * Go to your browser
		* Be logged-in to Lightsail
		* Click on the 3 dots on your instance and select 'Manage'
		* Click on the 'Networking' tab
		* Change the firewall configuration to match the internal firewall settings
		  above (only ports `80`(TCP), `123`(UDP), and `2200`(TCP) should be allowed
			 * make sure to deny the default port `22`)

13. Login by opening up the Terminal:

	  * `ssh -i ~/.ssh/lightrail_key.rsa -p 2200 ubuntu@XX.XX.XX.XX`,
	     change XX.XX.XX.XX to your instance's public IP address

Note: As mentioned above, connecting to the instance through a browser now no longer works; this is because Lightsail's browser-based SSH access only works through port `22`, which is now denied.


### Create a new user named `grader`
1. Run `sudo adduser grader`

2. Enter in a new UNIX password (twice) when prompted

3. Fill out information for the new `grader` user

4. To switch to the `grader` user, run `su - grader`, and enter the password


### Give `grader` user sudo permissions
1. Run `sudo visudo`

2. Find a line similar this:

	 * One will end in .pub

4. Login to the virtual machine

5. Switch to `grader`'s home directory

6. Create a new directory called `.ssh`
   * Run `mkdir .ssh`
   * Run `touch .ssh/authorized_keys`

7. On the local machine
   * Run `cat ~/.ssh/insert-name-of-file.pub`

8. Copy the contents of the file

9. Go onto the VM
   * Paste them in the .ssh/authorized_keys

10. On the virtual machine
    * Run `chmod 700 .ssh`

		* Check line '# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords'
		* If the next line says, 'PasswordAuthentication yes'
		* Change the 'yes' to 'no'
		* Save and exit the file
		* Run `sudo service ssh restart` (make sure to run this command after)

12. Login as the `grader` using the following command:

	`ssh -i ~/.ssh/grader_key -p 2200 grader@XX.XX.XX.XX`

Note that a window will pop-up asking for `grader`'s password

	```

  * Run `sudo service apache2 reload`


### Write a .wsgi file
1. Apache serves Flask applications by using a .wsgi file

2. Create a file called catalog.wsgi in /var/www/catalog

3. Add the following info to the file:

	```
	activate_this = '/var/www/catalog/catalog/venv/bin/activate_this.py'
execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))

#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
import logging
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr)
sys.path.insert(0,"/var/www/catalog/")

from catalog import app as application
application.secret_key = 'super_secret_key'
	```

  * Run `sudo service apache2 reload`



### Disable the default Apache site
1. To Disable the default Apache site
   * Run `sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf`

	The following prompt will be returned:

   `www-data` user
2. `cd` in to the /var/www directory
    * Run	`sudo chown -R www-data:www-data catalog/`
3. To edit these files use this example
    * sudo -u www-data nano File_Name


### Configure the database schema and populate
1. `cd` in to /var/www/catalog/catalog/
2. Activate the virtualenv
   * Run `. venv/bin/activate`
   * Run `python lotsofcars.py`

3. Deactivate the virtualenv
   * Run `deactivate`

4. Restart Apache
   * Run `sudo service apache2 restart`

5. Go to your browser and verify the app is working by visiting the following links
   * http://18.218.147.158
	 * http://ec2-18-218-147-158.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
